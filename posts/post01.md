What are great business leaders like? Hardworking, success-oriented, capable of inspiring others to follow them – sure. But that’s only part of the story.

Not all leaders are cut from the same cloth – and that’s actually good news. Think about somebody who maintains complete control, for instance. She might be fantastic for a complex, sprawling organization – but the same person wouldn’t necessarily suit a creative organization, where collaboration is key.

So what type of leader are you? By understanding this, you can overcome your weaknesses and seek out roles that play to your strengths. That way, you can increase your chances of success and gain those senior positions you’ve always dreamed of.

Like people, companies are diverse and experience ongoing change. Because of this, different organizations benefit from different leadership styles at different stages of their lives. Leaders who understand their own strengths, weaknesses, and personalities recognize which type of company will benefit most from their particular leadership style. This ability benefits both firms and leaders themselves.

If you want to join the next generation of leaders, prepare to face formidable challenges. Human leaders – the ninth type of leader – are future-oriented. Digitally savvy and ready to experiment in rapidly changing business environments, they’re brilliant at problem-solving. They’re also adept at mitigating the social and environmental impacts of their organizations.

To evolve into this type of leader, you need to recognize that decisions you make impact society; and you’ll also need to learn to foster profitability and sustainability, simultaneously.

Another important step is to commit yourself to inclusivity and clear communication. It’s all about creating a human-centric workplace. Recognize that people who work for your company are its core asset. They generate business solutions, sure, but they also act as your company’s advocates.

To become a human leader, then, you need to think about business, the environment, society, and people – all at the same time. This may be tricky, but this is the future.
